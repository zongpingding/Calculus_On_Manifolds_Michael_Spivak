The primary purpose of typesetting this book was to explore the \LaTeX{} typesetting workflow. 
It may also serve as an additional learning resource for \LaTeX{} available online.

The tools used in typesetting this book include: 
\begin{itemize} 
  \item \red{Simple\TeX{}}: \texttt{https://simpletex.cn/} 
  \item \red{Inkscape}: \texttt{https://inkscape.org/} 
  \item \red{Asymptote}: \texttt{https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/} 
\end{itemize}

Main websites referenced during the typesetting process: 
\begin{itemize} 
  \item \red{\TeX{} Stack Exchange}: \texttt{https://tex.stackexchange.com/} 
  \item \red{Stack Overflow}: \texttt{https://stackoverflow.com/} 
\end{itemize}

Back to the book itselfâ€”this document is a re-typeset version based on the original 
book \red{Calculus on Manifolds by Michael Spivak}. For more details about the book, 
see the Wikipedia page: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus\_on\_Manifolds\_(book)}{Calculus\_on\_Manifolds -- Wiki}.

The re-typeset version includes the following changes: \begin{itemize} \item All original figures have 
been redrawn \item Some symbols have been modified \item Various typesetting improvements \end{itemize}

  \noindent Typesetting is a highly niche field -- and it's far from simple.

  Of course, if anyone is interested in joining this project to help improve the book, 
  feel free to PR this Repo.
