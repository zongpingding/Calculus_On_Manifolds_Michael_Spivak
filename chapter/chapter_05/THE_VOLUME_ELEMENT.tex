\section{THE VOLUME ELEMENT}
Let $M$ be a $k$-dimensional manifold (or manifold-with-boundary) in $\F{R}^n$, 
with an orientation $\mu$. If $x\in M$, then $\mu_x$ and the inner product $T_x$ we defined 
previously determine a volume element $\omega(x) \in \Lambda^k(M_x)$. We therefore obtain a 
nowhere-zero $k$-form $\omega$ on $M$, which is called the \textbf{volume element}\index{Volume element}\indexsee{Element of volume}{Volume element} on $M$ 
(determined by $\mu$) and denoted $\dd V$, even though it is not generally the differential 
of a $(k-1)$-form. The \textbf{volume}\index{Volume} of $M$ is defined as $\int_M \;\dd V$, provided this integral 
exists, which is certainly the case if $M$ is compact. ``Volume'' is usually called \textbf{length}\index{Length} or 
\textbf{surface area}\index{Surface area}\index{Area!surface} for one- and two-dimensional manifolds, and $\dd V$ is denoted as 
(the ``element of length'')\index{Length!element of}\index{Element of area}\index{Area!element of}\index{Element of length} or 
$\dd A$ [or $\dd S$] (the ``element of [surface] area'').

A concrete case of interest to us is the volume element of an oriented \textbf{surface}\index{Surface}\index{Area!surface} 
(two-dimensional manifold) $M$ in $\F{R}^3$. Let $n(x)$ be the unit outward normal at
$x\in M$. If $\omega\in \Lambda^2(M_x)$ is defined by 
\begin{align*}
    \omega(v, w) = \det \begin{pmatrix}v\\ w\\ n(x)\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*} 

then $\omega(v,w)=1$ if $v$ and $w$ are an orthonomal basis of $M_x$ with $[v, w]=\mu_x$. 
Thus $\dd A=\omega$. On the other hand, $\omega(v, w)=\langle v\times w, n(x)\rangle$ by definition
of $v\times w$. Thus we have 
\begin{align*}
    \dd A(v, w) = \langle v\times w, n(x)\rangle
\end{align*}

Since $v\times w$ is a multiple of $n(x)$ for $v,w\in M_x$, we conclude that 
\begin{align*}
    \dd A(v, w) = |v\times w|
\end{align*} 

if $[v, w]=\mu_x$. If we wish to compute area of $M$, we must evaluate $\int_{[0,1]^2} c^*(\dd A)$ for 
orientation-preserving singular 2-cubes. Define 
\begin{align*}
    & E(a) = [\R{D}_1c^1(a)]^2 + [\R{D}_1c^2(a)]^2 + [\R{D}_1c^3(a)]^2\\
    & F(a) = [\R{D}_1c^1(a)]\cdot[\R{D}_2c^1(a)] \\
    & \hspace*{2.2em} + [\R{D}_1c^2(a)]\cdot[\R{D}_2c^2(a)] + [\R{D}_1c^3(a)]\cdot[\R{D}_2c^3(a)]\\
    & G(a) = [\R{D}_2c^1(a)]^2 + [\R{D}_2c^2(a)]^2 + [\R{D}_2c^3(a)]^2
\end{align*}

Then 
\begin{align*}
    & c^*(\dd A)((e_1)_a, (e_2)_a) = \dd A(c_*(e_1)_a, c_*(e_2)_a) \\
    & = |(\R{D}_1c^1(a), \R{D}_1c^2(a), \R{D}_1c^3(a)) \times (\R{D}_2c^1(a), \R{D}_2c^2(a), \R{D}_2c^3(a))| \\
    & = \sqrt{E(a)G(a) - F(a)^2}
\end{align*}

by Problem 4-9. Thus 
\begin{align*}
    \int_{[0,1]^2} c^*(\dd A) = \int_{[0,1]^2} \sqrt{EG-F^2}
\end{align*}

Calculating surface area is clearly a foolhardy enterprise;
fortunately one seldom needs to know the \textbf{area}\index{Surface area} of a surface.
Moreover, there is a simple expression for $\dd A$ which suffices for
theoretical considerations.

\begin{theorem}
    Let $M$ be an oriented two-dimensional manifold (or manifold-with-boundary) in $\F{R}^3$ 
    and let n be the unit outward normal. Then
    \begin{align}
        \dd A=n^1\dd y\wedge\dd z+n^2\dd z\wedge\dd x+n^3\dd x\wedge\dd y.
    \end{align}

    Moreover 
    \begin{align}
        n^1\dd A & = \dd y\wedge \dd z\\
        n^2\dd A & = \dd z\wedge \dd x\\
        n^3\dd A & = \dd x\wedge \dd y
    \end{align}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Equation (1) is equivalent to the equation
    \begin{align*}
        \dd A(v, w) = \det 
        \begin{pmatrix}
            v\\ w\\ n(x)
        \end{pmatrix}
    \end{align*}

    This is seen by expanding the determinant by minors along the bottom row.
    To prove the other equations, let $z\in\F{R}^3_x$. Since $v\times w=\alpha n(x)$ for some 
    $\alpha\in\F{R}$, we have 
    \begin{align*}
        \langle z, n(x)\rangle\cdot \langle v\times w, n(x)\rangle
        & = \langle z, n(x)\rangle\alpha 
        & = \langle z, \alpha n(x)\rangle
        & = \langle z, v\times w\rangle
    \end{align*}

    Choosing $z=e_1, e_2$, and $e_3$ we obtain (2), (3), and (4).
\end{proof}


A word of caution: if $\omega\in \Lambda^2(\F{R}^3_a)$ is defined by 
\begin{align*}
    \omega
    = n^1(a)\cdot \dd y(a)\wedge\dd z(a)
    + n^{2}(a)\cdot\dd z(a)\wedge\dd x(a)
    + n^{3}(a)\cdot\dd x(a)\wedge\dd y(a)
\end{align*}

it is not true, for example, that
\begin{align*}
    n^1(a)\cdot\omega = \dd y(a)\wedge\dd z(a)
\end{align*}

    3, 4, 7, 8, etc., sufficiently small, the total area of the inscribed surface can be made as 
    large as desired.}}

\end{figure}

A few remarks should be made to justify the definition of
length and surface area we have given. If $c:[0,1]\to \F{R}^n$ is
differentiable and $c([0,1])$ is a one-dimensional manifold-with-
boundary, it can be shown, but the proof is messy, that the
length of $c([0,1])$ is indeed the least upper bound of the lengths
of inscribed broken lines. If $c:[0,1]^2\to \F{R}^n$, one naturally
hopes that the area of $c([0,1]^2)$ will be the least upper bound of
the areas of surfaces made up of triangles whose vertices lie in
$c([0,1]^2)$. Amazingly enough, such a least upper bound is
usually nonexistent-one can find inscribed polygonal surfaces
arbitrarily close to $c([0,1]^2)$ with arbitrarily large area! This
is indicated for a cylinder in Figure \ref{Fig 5-9}. Many definitions
of surface area have been proposed, disagreeing with each
other, but all agreeing with our definition for differentiable
surfaces. For a discussion of these difficult questions the
reader is referred to References \cite{cesari1956surface} or \cite{rad61948length}.
