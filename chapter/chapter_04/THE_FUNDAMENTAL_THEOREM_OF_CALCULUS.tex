The fact that $\dd^2 = 0$ and $\partial^2 = 0$, not to mention the typographical 
similarity of $\dd$ and $\partial$, suggests some connection between chains and forms. 
This connection is established by integrating forms over chains. Henceforth only 
differentiable singular $n$-cubes will be considered.

If $\omega$ ia s $k$-form on $[0,1]^k$, then $\omega = f\dd x^1\wedge\cdots\wedge\dd x^k$
for a unique function $f$. We define 
\begin{align*}
  \int_{[0,1]^k} \omega = \int_{[0,1]^k} f.
\end{align*}

We could also write this as
\begin{align*}
  \int_{[0,1]^k} f\dd x^1\wedge\cdots\wedge\dd x^k = \int_{[0,1]^k} f(x^1,\cdots,x^k)\;\dd x^1\cdots\dd x^k,
\end{align*}

one of the reasons for introducing the functions $x^i$. 

If $\omega$ is a $k$-form on $A$ and $c$ is a singular $k$-cube in $A$, we define
\begin{align*}
  \int_c\omega=\int_{[0,1]^k}c^*\omega.
\end{align*}

Note, in particular, that
\begin{align*}
    \int_{I^k}fdx^1\wedge\cdots\wedge\;\dd x^k
    & = \int\limits_{[0,1]^k}(I^k)^*(f\;\dd x^1\wedge\cdots\wedge \dd x^k) \\
    & = \int_{[0,1]^k}f(x^1,\cdots,x^k)\; \dd x^1\cdots\dd x^k.
\end{align*}

A special definition must be made for $k = 0$. A 0-form $\omega$ is a function; 
if $c:\{0\}\to A$ is a singular 0-cube in $A$ we define
\begin{align*}
  \int_c \omega = \omega(c(0)).
\end{align*}

The integral of $\omega$ over a $k$-chain $c = \sum_{}^{}{a_ic_i}$ is defined by
\begin{align*}
    \int_c\omega=\sum a_i\int_{c_i}\omega.
\end{align*}

The integral\index{Integral!of a form over a chain} of a 1-form over a 1-chain is often called a \textbf{line integral}\index{Line integral}. 
If $P\dd x + Q\dd y$ is a 1-form on $\F{R}^2$ and $c:[0,1]\to\F{R}^2$
is a singular 1-cube (a curve), then one can (but we will not) prove that
\begin{align*}
    \int_c P\dd x+Q\dd y
    & = \lim\sum_{i=1}^n\left[c^1(t_i)-c^1(t_{i-1})\right]\cdot P(c(t^i)) \\
    & \qquad + \left[c^2(t_i)-c^2(t_{i-1})\right]\cdot Q(c(t^i))
\end{align*}
where $t_0,\cdots,t_n$ is a partition of $[0,1]$, the choice of $t^i$ in
$[t_{i-1},t_i]$ is arbitrary, and the limit is taken over all partitions
as the maximum of $|t_i-t_{i-1}|$ goes to 0.The right side is often taken as a definition 
of $\int_c P \dd x + Q \dd y$. This is a natural definition to make, since these sums are 
very much like the sums appearing in the definition of ordinary integrals. However such an 
expression is almost impossible to work with and is quickly equated with an integral equivalent 
to $\int_{[0,1]}c^*(P \dd x+ Q \dd y)$. Analogous definitions for \textbf{surface integrals}\index{Surface integral}\index{Integral!surface}, that
is, integrals of 2-forms over singular 2-cubes, are even more complicated and difficult to use.
This is one reason why we have avoided such an approach. The other reason is that the definition 
given here is the one that makes sense in the more general situations considered in Chapter 5.

The relationship between forms, chains, d, and $\partial$ is summed up in the neatest possible way 
by Stokes' theorem, sometimes called the fundamental theorem of calculus in higher dimensions 
(if $k = 1$ and $c = I^1$ it really is the fundamental theorem of calculus).

\begin{theorem}[Stokes' Theorem]\index{Stokes' Theorem}
    If $\omega$ is a $(k-1 )$-form on an open set $A\subset\F{R}^n$ and $c$ is a $k$-chain in $A$, then
    \begin{align*}
      \int\limits_c\;\dd\omega=\int\limits_{\partial c}\omega.
    \end{align*}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose first that $c = I^k$ and $\omega$ is a $(k-1)$-form on $[0,1]^k$.
    Then $\omega$ is the sum of $(k-1)$-forms of the type
    \begin{align*}
      f\dd x^1\wedge\cdots\wedge\widehat{\dd x^i}\wedge\cdots\wedge \dd x^k,
    \end{align*}
    and it suffices to prove the theorem for each of these. This simply involves a 
    computation:

    Note that, if $i=j$, then
    % \begin{align*}
    %     & \int_{[0,1]^{k-1}}I_{(j,{\alpha})}^{*}(f\dd x^1\wedge\cdots\wedge\widehat{dx^i}\wedge\cdots\wedge \dd x^k) \\
    %     & \hspace*{6em} = \left\{\begin{aligned}
    %         & 0 && \text{ if } j\neq i \\
    %         & \int_{[0,1]^k} f(x^1,\cdots,x^k)\;\dd x^1\cdots\dd x^k && \text{ if } j = i
    %     \end{aligned}\right.
    % \end{align*}
    \begin{align*}
      \int_{[0,1]^{k-1}}I_{(j,{\alpha})}^{*}(f\dd x^1\wedge\cdots\wedge\widehat{dx^i}\wedge\cdots\wedge \dd x^k) 
      = \int_{[0,1]^k} f(x^1,\cdots,x^k)\;\dd x^1\cdots\dd x^k
    \end{align*}
    if $i\neq j$, then the left side equals to 0. Therefore 
    \begin{align*}
        & \int_{\partial I^k} f\dd x^1\wedge\cdots\wedge \dd x^k\wedge\cdots\wedge\dd x^k \\
        & = \sum_{j=1}^{k}\sum_{\alpha=0,1}(-1)^{j+\alpha}\int_{[0,1]^{k-1}}I_{(j,\alpha)}^{k}*(f\dd x^1\wedge\cdots\wedge\widehat{\dd x^i}\wedge\cdots\wedge\dd x^k) \\
        & = (-1)^{i+1}\int_{[0,1]^k}f(x^1,\cdots, 1, \cdots,x^k)\dd x^1\cdots \dd x^k \\
        & \hspace*{1em} +(-1)^i\int_{[0,1]^k}f(x^1,\ldots,0,\ldots,x^k)\dd x^1\cdots \dd x^k.
    \end{align*}

    On the other hand,
    \begin{align*}
        & \int_{I^{k}}\;\dd(f \dd x^1\wedge\cdots\wedge\widehat{\dd x^i}\wedge\cdots\wedge \dd x^k) \\
        & = \int_{[0,1]^k}\R{D}_i f\;\dd x^i\wedge\dd x^1\wedge\cdots\wedge\widehat{\dd x^i}\wedge\cdots\wedge\dd x^k \\
        & = (-1)^{i-1}\int_{[0,1]^k} {\R{D}_i f}.
    \end{align*}

    By Fubini's theorem and the fundamental theorem of calculus (in one dimension) we have
    \begin{align*}
        & \int_{I^{k}}\;\dd(f \dd x^1\wedge\cdots\wedge\widehat{\dd x^i}\wedge\cdots\wedge \dd x^k) \\
        & = (-1)^{i-1}\int_{0}^{1}\cdots\left(\int_{0}^{1}\R{D}_{i}f(x^{1},\cdots,x^{k})\;\dd x^{i}\right)\dd x^{1}\cdots\widehat{\dd x^i}\cdots\dd x^k\\
        & = (-1)^{i-1}\int_{0}^{1}\cdots\int_{0}^{1}\big[f(x^{1},\cdots,1,\cdots,x^{k}) \\
        & \hspace*{8.5em} - f(x^{1},\cdots,0,\cdots,x^{k})\big]\;\dd x^{1}\cdots\widehat{\dd x^i}\cdots\dd x^k\\
        & = (-1)^{i-1}\int_{[0,1]^k} f(x^1,\cdots,1,\cdots,x^k)\;\dd x^1\cdots\dd x^k \\
        & + (-1)^{i-1}\int_{[0,1]^k} f(x^1,\cdots,0,\cdots,x^k)\;\dd x^1\cdots\dd x^k.
    \end{align*}

    Thus 
    \begin{align*}
        \int_{I^k}\;\dd\omega=\int_{\partial I^k}\omega.
    \end{align*}

    If $c$ is an arbitrary singular $k$-cube, working through the definitions will show that
    \begin{align*}
        \int_{\partial c}\omega=\int_{\partial I^k}c^*\omega.
    \end{align*}

    Therefore 
    \begin{align*}
        \int_{c}\;\dd\omega
        = \int_{I^{k}}c^{*}(\dd\omega)
        = \int_{I^{k}}\;\dd(c^{*}\omega)
        = \int_{\partial I^{k}}c^{*}\omega
        = \int_{\partial c}\omega.
    \end{align*}

    Finally, if $c$ is a $k$-chain $\sum a_ic_i$, we have 
    \begin{align*}
        \int_c\;\dd\omega
        = \sum a_i\int_{c_i}\;\dd\omega
        = \sum a_i\int_{\partial c_i}\omega
        = \int_{\partial c}\omega.
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

Stokes' theorem shares three important attributes with
many fully evolved major theorems:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item It is trivial. 
    \item It is trivial because the terms appearing in it have been properly defined.
    \item It has significant consequences.
\end{enumerate}
Since this entire chapter was little more than a series of definitions which made the 
statement and proof of Stokes' theorem possible, the reader should be willing to grant the
first two of these attributes to Stokes' theorem. The rest of the book is devoted to 
justifying the third.
